# WebDev Journey portfolio WebPage

## Description

This project is a personal website portfolio developed to showcase my web development skills using HTML and CSS. The primary goal of this project was to create a visually appealing and responsive website that serves as a platform to display my projects, skills, and experience to potential employers and clients.

My web portfolio demonstrates proficiency in HTML and CSS, creating well-structured layouts with semantic elements. I prioritized responsive design using media queries, ensuring the site looks great on any device. Flexbox and Grid provided dynamic layouts, while CSS variables maintained consistent styling. Smooth scrolling enhances the user experience, and version control streamlined collaboration. For version control, I utilized GitHub, a popular platform that allowed me to track changes, manage different versions of the project, and collaborate with others in future cases. The portfolio reflects both technical skills and growth as a web developer, offering captivating and user-friendly experiences.
